### Lessons From the Tsurezuregusa
#### On One's Aim in Life
The best thing to do in life is to study literature, poetry, and music. Becoming an authority on ancient practices is commendable. One who does not refuse a little wine is a good man.

#### On a Life of Seclusion
It is as if one were gazing at the moon in some far distant place of exile, to which, however, no crime had banished one.

#### On Being Against a Prolonged Existence
No life can be better than to die at the age of forty. If we lived for over a thousand years, they would seem but as a dream of a single night.

#### On Reading
Nothing is more refreshing than an open book, a lamp, and solitude.

#### On a Mountain Retreat
Seclusion in a mountain temple in attendance of the gods will cause even an impure heart to feel cleansed.

#### On the Simple Life
In China there was once a man called Kyo Yu who had no possessions of any kind; and somebody, on seeing him drink water by scooping it up in his hand, gave him a gourd. He hung it up on the branch of a tree where it made such a noise blowing about in the wind that he threw it away, and once more drank water from his hands.
