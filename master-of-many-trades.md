### Master of Many Trades
Our age reveres the specialist but humans are natural polymaths, at our best when we turn our minds to many things.

The real master has not tools at all, only a limitless capacity to improvise with what is at hand. 

"A man can do all things if he will." - Leon Battista Alberti

Leonardo da Vinci was said to be as proud of his ability to bend iron bars with his hands as he was of the Mona Lisa.

We can’t all be geniuses. But we do all still indulge in polymathic activity; it’s part of what makes us human.

Over-specialization, eventually retreats into defending what one has learnt rather than making new connections.
The old Renaissance idea of mastering physical as well as intellectual skills appears to have real grounding in improving our general ability to learn new things.

The fact is, if we exclude the physicality of existence and reduce everything worth knowing down to book-learning, we miss out on a huge chunk of what makes us human.
